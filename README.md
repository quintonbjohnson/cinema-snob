About
-----------------------------
CinemaSnob is an app developed for a course project in which we were tasked to create a movie recommender utilizing the Rotten Tomatoes API. The app connects using JSON and Volley and uses a Model-View-Controller framework.

CinemaSnob has not been published to the Google Play Store, but feel free to clone the repository and open the app with Android Studio to run and tinker with the application. In your emulator configuration set the "app" package to the working module with LoginScreenActivity as the specified starting activity.
