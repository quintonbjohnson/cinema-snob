About
-----------------------------
CinemaSnob is an app developed for a course project in which we were tasked to create a movie recommender. The app interfaces with the Rotten Tomatoes API using JSON and Volley and uses a Model-View-Controller framework. Users can make a profile and search, sort, and rate movies.

CinemaSnob has not been published to the Google Play Store, but feel free to clone the repository and open the app with Android Studio to run and tinker with the application. In your emulator configuration set the "app" package to the working module with LoginScreenActivity as the specified starting activity.
