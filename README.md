About
-----------------------------
CinemaSnob is an app developed for a course project in which we were tasked to create a movie recommender. Users can make a profile and search, sort, and rate movies.

CinemaSnob has not been published to the Google Play Store, as the user interface has not been finalized. However, the application provides full functionality. The application also demonstrates a cohesive and strong coding style, a Model-View-Controller framework, and the use of the Rotten Tomatoes API and JSON. Feel free to clone the repository and open the app with Android Studio to run and tinker with the application. In your emulator configuration set the "app" package to the working module with LoginScreenActivity as the specified starting activity.
